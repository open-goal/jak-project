# OpenGOAL Document
This is the main documentation for the OpenGOAL language. It's designed to be read in order to learn OpenGOAL. It does not explain the OpenGOAL kernel or state system.

The syntax description uses these rules:
- Something `[in-brackets]` is optional and can be left out. 
- Something like `[:type type-name]` means there is an optional named argument. It can be used like `:type type-name`, replacing `type-name` with what you want, or left out entirely.
- When there are multiple choices, they are separated by `|`. Example: `#t|#f` is either `#t` or `#f`.
- A `...` means more of the thing before can be included. Example `(f arg...)` can have multiple arguments.

# Language Basics
OpenGOAL is a compiled language. Source code is stored in `.gc` files. Each `.gc` file is compiled into a `.o` file.  These `.o` files are then loaded by the game. When they are loaded, it has the effect of running every "top level" expression in the file. Usually these are function, type, and method declarations, but you can also use this for initialization code.  For example, it is common to first define types, functions, and methods, then set up global instances.

There are effectively three different "languages":
1. OpenGOAL - the normal compiled language. 
2. OpenGOAL compiler commands - simple commands to run the compiler, listener, and debugger.  These run in the compiler only.
3. GOOS macro language.  This is used in OpenGOAL macros and runs at compile-time. These macros generate OpenGOAL compiler commands or OpenGOAL source which is then processed. These run in the compiler only.

The OpenGOAL language uses a LISP syntax, but on the inside is closer to C or C++. There is no protection against use-after-free or other common pointer bugs.

Unlike a C/C++ compiler, the OpenGOAL compiler has a state. It remembers functions/methods/types/macros/constants/enums/etc defined in previous files.

# Compiler REPL
 When you start the OpenGOAL compiler, you'll see a prompt like this:
 ```
 OpenGOAL Compiler 0.2
g  > 
 ```
The `g` indicates that you can input OpenGOAL compiler commands.  For example:

***
### `(e)` - Compiler Command
Exit Compiler
```lisp
(e)
```
Exit the compiler once the current REPL command is finished. Takes no arguments. If we are connected to a target through the listener, attempts to reset the target.
***
### `(:exit)` - Compiler Command
Exit Compiler
```lisp
(:exit)
```
Same as `(e)`, just requires more typing. `(e)` is actually a macro for `(:exit)`. Takes no arguments.
***
### `(lt)` - Compiler Command
Listen to Target
```lisp
(lt ["ip address"] [port-number])
```
Connect the listener to a running target. The IP address defaults to `"127.0.0.1"` and the port to `8112` (`DECI2_PORT` in `listener_common.h`). These defaults are usually what you want, so you can just run `(lt)` to connect.

Example:
```lisp
g  > (lt)
[Listener] Socket connected established! (took 0 tries). Waiting for version...
Got version 0.2 OK!
[Debugger] Context: valid = true, s7 = 0x147d24, base = 0x2000000000, tid = 1296302
gc >
```
***
### `r`
Reset the target.
```lisp
(r ["ip address"] [port-number])
```
Regardless of the current state, attempt to reset the target and reconnect. After this, the target will have nothing loaded.  Like with `(lt)`, the default IP and port are probably what you want.

Note: `r` is actually a macro. 
***
### `shutdown-target`
If the target is connected, make it exit.
```lisp
(shutdown-target)
```
The target will print
```
GOAL Runtime Shutdown (code 2)
```
before it exits.
***
### `:status`
Ping the target.
```lisp
(:status)
```
Send a ping-like message to the target. Requires the target to be connected. If successful, prints nothing.  Will time-out and display and error message if the GOAL kernel or code dispatched by the kernel is stuck in an infinite loop.  Unlikely to be used often.
***
 
 ## Connecting To Target Example
```lisp
;; we cannot execute OpenGOAL code unless we connect the listener
g  > (+ 1 2 3)
REPL Error: Compilation generated code, but wasn't supposed to

;; connect to the target
g  > (lt)
[Listener] Socket connected established! (took 0 tries). Waiting for version...
Got version 0.2 OK!
[Debugger] Context: valid = true, s7 = 0x147d24, base = 0x2000000000, tid = 1297692

;; execute OpenGOAL code
gc > (+ 1 2 3)
6

;; quit the compiler and reset the target for next time.
gc > (e)
[Listener] Closed connection to target
```
Once we are connected, we see that there is a `gc` prompt. This indicates that the listener has an open socket connection. Now the REPL will accept both compiler commands and OpenGOAL source code.  All `(format #t ...` debugging prints (like `printf`) will show up in this REPL. Each time you run something in the REPL, the result is printed as a decimal number. If the result doesn't make sense to print as a decimal, or there is no result, you will get some random number.

In the future there will be a fancier printer here.

# OpenGOAL Type System
OpenGOAL has a type system. Every expression and object in OpenGOAL has a type. With the exception of three special types (`none`, `_varags_`, and `_types_`), every type has a parent type, and the root of all types is `object`.  Types themselves are objects in the runtime that contain some basic information and their method table.

One annoying detail of OpenGOAL is that the type system has some slightly different types for variables and places in memory, and automatic conversions between them.

Another annoying detail is that there are a totally separate set of rules for 128-bit integer types (or children of these). Nothing in this section applies to these.

Some types are boxed vs. unboxed. If you have an object of boxed type, it is possible to figure out its type at runtime. If you have an object of unboxed type, you can't.  If you have an unboxed type, you can't tell if it's a boxed or unboxed object.

Some types are value or reference. A value type means it has value semantics, it is passed by value everywhere. A reference type is like a C/C++ pointer or reference, where there is memory allocated for the data somewhere, and the you just pass around a reference to this memory.

## Built-in Types
There are a number of built-in types. I use "abstract" type to refer to a type that is only a parent type .

### `none`
This is a special type that represents "no information". This is the return type of a function which returns nothing, and also the return type of an expression that doesn't return anything.  For example, the expression `(goto x)` does not produce a value, so its type is `none`.

### `object`
This is the parent type of all types. This is an abstract class. In a variable, this is always `object`, and can hold any `object`. In memory, this is either `object32` or `object64`. The `object32` can hold everything except for `binteger` and 64-bit integers. This type is neither boxed nor unboxed and is neither value nor reference.

### `structure` (child of `object`)
This is the parent type of all types with fields. This is an abstract class and a reference class.  A `structure` can hold any `structure`, both in memory and in a variable.  It is unboxed.

### `basic` (child of `structure`)
This is the "boxed" version of `structure`. The first field of a basic is `type`, which contains the `type` of the object. It is boxed and a reference. A `basic` can hold any `basic`, both in memory and in a variable.

### `symbol` (child of `basic`)
A symbol has a name and a value. The name is a string, and the value is an `object32`.  Note that the value is an `object32` so you cannot store a 64-bit integer in a symbol.  It is considered "bad" to store unboxed objects in symbols, though you can get away with it sometimes.

All `symbol`s are stored in the global symbol table, which is a hash table. As a result, you cannot have multiple symbols with the same name. A name is enough to uniquely determine the symbol.  To get a symbol, use the syntax `'symbol-name`. To get the value, use `symbol-name`.

Each global variable, type, and named global function has a symbol for it which has the variable, type, or function as its value. The linker is able to perform symbol table lookups at link time and patch the code so you don't have to do a hash table lookup every time you access a global variable, function, or type.  

You can also use symbols as a efficient way to represent a enum. For example, a function may return `'error` or `'complete` as a status. The compiler is able to compare symbols for equality very efficiently (just a pointer comparison, as symbols are a reference type).

### `type` (child of `basic`)
A `type` stores information about an OpenGOAL type, including its size, parent, and name (stored as a `symbol`). It also stores the method table.  Some OpenGOAL types (children of integers, bitfield types, enums, compounds types) do not have runtime types, and instead become the parent/base type. But these types cannot have runtime type information or methods and are pretty rare.  It is a reference type, is boxed, and is dynamically sized (the method table's size is not fixed).

### `string` (child of `basic`)
A string. The string is null terminated and also stores the buffer size. This type is a reference type, is boxed, and is also dynamically sized.

### `function` (child of `basic`)
A function. Boxed and reference. It is a reference to a function, so it's like a C/C++ function pointer type.

### `kheap` (child of `structure`)
A simple bump-allocated heap. Doesn't store the heap memory, just metadata. Supports allocating from either the top or the bottom. This is used as the memory allocation strategy for the global, debug, and level heaps. Unboxed, reference, not dynamic.

### `array` (child of `basic`)
A "fancy" array. It is not yet implemented in OpenGOAL.

### `pair` (child of `object`)
A pair. It is boxed. You should not make child types of `pair`.  The two objects stored by the pair are `object32`s.

### `pointer` (child of `object`)
It is a 32-bit value type containing a pointer. Not boxed, value type. See section on compound types for more information.

### `number` (child of `object`)
Abstract type for all numbers. Value type. 64-bits.

### `float` (child of `number`)
4-byte, single precision floating point number.  Value type.

### `integer` (child of `number`)
Abstract class for integer numbers. Child classes are `sinteger` (signed integer), `uinteger` (unsigned integer), and `binteger` (boxed-integer, always signed).  These are all 64-bit types.

Children of `sinteger` and `uinteger` are `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`.  These are the size you expect, value types, and not boxed. These only exist as memory types. In a variable, there is only `int` and `uint`.  These are both 64-bit types. All integer operations (math, logical, shifts) are 64-bit.

The `binteger` is a boxed integer. It is a 61 bit signed integer (the other three bits are lost due to the number being boxed). There may actually be a `buinteger` (or `ubinteger`) but it doesn't exist in OpenGOAL at this point.

### Weird Built-in types that aren't supported yet.
- `vu-function`
- `link-block`
- `connectable`
- `file-stream`
- `inline-array` (class)

## Compound Types
A compound type is a type like "a pointer to an int64" or "a function which takes int as an argument and returns a string". These exist only at compile time, and get simplified at runtime. For example, all pointers become `pointer` and all functions become `function`. (The one exception to this seems to be `inline-array-class` stuff, but this is not yet supported in OpenGOAL).

### Pointer
Pointers work like you would expect. They can only point to memory types - you can't have a `(pointer int)`, instead you must have a `(pointer int32)` (for example).  Note that a `(pointer basic)` is like a C++ `basic**` as `basic` is already like a C++ pointer to struct. You can nest these, like `(pointer (pointer int64))`.  If you want a pointer with no type, (like C++ `void*`) just use a plain `pointer`. The `(pointer none)` type is invalid.

Like in C/C++, you can use array indexing with a pointer. One thing to note is that a `(pointer basic)` (or pointer to any reference type) is like a C++ "array of pointers to structs". To get the C++ "array of structs", you need an `inline-array`. 

### Inline Array
These are only valid for reference types. They refer to an array of the actual data (like C array of structs) rather than an array of reference (like C array of pointers to structs, or GOAL `(pointer structure)`).  At runtime, `inline-array` becomes pointer.

For an inline array of basics, elements are 16-byte aligned. For `structure`s that aren't `basic`, the alignment is usually the minimum alignment of all members of the structure, but there is an option to make it 16-byte aligned if needed.

For information about how to create these arrays, see `deftype` (fields in a type) and `new` (create just an array) sections.

### Function
Function compound types look like this `(function arg0-type arg1-type... return-type)`. There can be no arguments. The `return-type` must always be specified, and should be `none` if there is no return value.  The argument types themselves can be compound types.  In order to call a function, you must have a compound function type - a `function` by itself cannot be called.

 
## Field Definitions
GOAL field definitions look like this:  
  
`(name type-name [optional stuff])`  
  
where optional stuff can include these, in any order:  
  
- `:inline #t` (default is false), to mark field as inline. This can only be done for a reference type, and indicates that the data should be stored inline, in the type, rather than just storing a reference to data stored elsewhere.  
- `:dynamic #t` (default is false), to mark field as dynamically-sized array (must be the last field in the type)  
- a number, to give an array size.  
- `:offset x` where x is a number, to manually specify where the field is located  
  
There are many combinations of reference/value, dynamic/not-dynamic, inline/not-inline, array-size/no-array-size, and it can be confusing.  This list explains all that are valid.  
  
- Value type, no modifiers: a single value is stored in the field. The field type is the value type.  
- Value type, `:dynamic #t`: the field marks the beginning of an array (of unknown size). Field type is `(pointer your-type)`  
- Value type, with array size: the field marks the beginning of an array (of known size). Field type is `(pointer your-type)`  
- Value type, with `:inline #t`: invalid in all cases.  
- Reference type, no modifiers: a single reference is stored in the type. Type of field is `your-type` (a C++ pointer).    
- Reference type, `:inline #t`: a single object is stored inside the type. Type of field is `your-type` still (a C++ pointer). The access logic is different to make this work.  
- Reference type, `:dynamic #t` or array size: the field marks the beginning of an **array of references**. Field type is `(pointer your-type)`.  Like C array of pointers.  
- Reference type, `:inline #t` and (`:dynamic #t` or array size): the field marks the beginning of an **array of inline objects**. Field type is `(inline-array your-type)`. Like C array of structs.  
  
Bonus ones, for where the array is stored _outside_ of the type:  
- A dynamically typed GOAL array, stored outside your type (think `std::vector`): use `(name (array your-type))`  
- A dynamically type GOAL array, stored inside your type: Not allowed, `array` is dynamic!  
- An array of value types, stored outside your type: use `(name (pointer your-type))`  
- An array of references (C++ array of pointers), stored outside your type: use `(name (pointer your-ref-type))`  
- An array of objects of reference type (C++ array of structs), stored outside your type: use `(name (inline-array your-ref-type))`  
  
Of course, you can combine these, to get even more confusing types! But this seems uncommon.

## Dynamic Size Types
Any type which ends with a dynamic array as the last field is dynamic. For these, it's a good idea to implement the `asize-of` method.

# OpenGOAL Method System
OpenGOAL has a virtual method system. This means that child types can override parent methods.  The first argument to a method is always the object the method is being called on, except for `new`.

## Special Method Type: `_type_`
Methods have the same type as `function`. But they are allowed to use the special type `_type_`, which means "the compile-time type of the object the method is being called on".  The type system is flexible with allowing you to use `_type_` in the method declaration in `deftype`, but not using `_type_` in the actual `defmethod`.

## Built in Methods
All types have these 9 methods. They have reasonable defaults if you don't provide anything.

### `new`
The new method is a very special method used to construct a new object, like a constructor. Note that some usages of the `new` keyword __do not__ end up calling the new method. See the `new` section for more details. Unlike C++, fields of a type and elements in an array are not constructed either.

The first argument is an "allocation", indicating where the object should be constructed. It can be
- The symbol `'global` or `'debug`, indicating the global or debug heaps
- The symbols `'process-level-heap` or `'loading-level`, indicating whatever heaps are stored in those symbols.
- `'process`, indicating the allocation should occur on the current process heap.
- `'scratch`, for allocating on the scratchpad. This is unused.
- Otherwise it's treated as a 16-byte aligned address and used for in place construction (it zeros the memory first)

The second argument is the "type to make".  It might seem stupid at first, but it allows child classes to use the same `new` method as the parent class.

The remaining arguments can be used for whatever you want.

When writing your own `new` methods, you should ignore the `allocation` argument and use the `object-new` macro to actually do the allocation.  This takes care of all the details for getting the memory (and setting up runtime type information if its a basic).  See the section on `object-new` for more details.

### `delete`
This method isn't really used very much. Unlike a C++ destructor it's never called automatically. In some cases, it's repurposed as a "clean up" type function but it doesn't actually free any memory.  It takes no arguments.  The default implementations call `kfree` on what the allocation, but there are two issues:
1. The implementation is sometimes wrong, likely confusing doing pointer math (steps by array stride) with address math (steps by one byte).
2. The `kfree` function does nothing.

The `kheap` system doesn't really support freeing objects unless you free in the opposite order you allocate, so it makes sense that `delete` doesn't really work.

### `print`
This method should print out a short description of the object (with no newlines) and return the object.  The printing should be done with `(format #t ...)` (see the section on `format`) for more information.  If you call `print` by itself, it'll make this description show up in the REPL. (Note that there is some magic involved to add a newline here... there's actually a function named `print` that calls the `print` method and adds a newline)

The default short description looks like this: `#<test-type @ #x173e54>` for printing an object of type `test-type`. Of course, you can override it with a better version.  Built-in types like string, type, boxed integer, pair, have reasonable overrides. 

This method is also used to print out the object with `format`'s `~A` format option.

### `inspect`
This method should print out a detailed, multi-line description. By default, `structure`s and `basic`s will have an auto-generated method that prints out the name and value of all fields.  For example:

```
gc > (inspect *kernel-context*)
[00164b44] kernel-context
  prevent-from-run: 65
  require-for-run: 0
  allow-to-run: 0
  next-pid: 2
  fast-stack-top: 1879064576
  current-process: #f
  relocating-process: #f
  relocating-min: 0
  relocating-max: 0
  relocating-offset: 0
  low-memory-message: #t
```

In some cases this method is overridden to provide nicer formatting.

### `length`
This method should return a "length".  The default method for this just returns 0, but for things like strings or buffers, it could be used to return the number of characters or elements in use.  It's usually used to refer to how many are used, rather than the capacity.

### `asize-of`
This method should return the size of the object. Including the 4 bytes of type info for a `basic`.

By default this grabs the value from the object's `type`, which is only correct for non-dynamic types. For types like `string` or other dynamic types, this method should be overridden. If you intend to store dynamically sized objects of a given type on a process heap, you __must__ implement this method accurately.

### `copy`
Creates a copy of the object. I don't think this used very much.  Just does a `memcpy` to duplicate by default.

### `relocate`
The exact details are still unknown, but is used to update internal data structures after an object is moved in memory. This must be support for objects allocated in process heaps of processes allocated on the actor heap or debug actor heap.

It's also called on objects loaded from a GOAL data object file.

### `mem-usage`
Not much is known yet, but used for computing memory usage statistics.


## Details on the Order of Overrides
The order in which you `defmethod` and `deftype` matters.

When you `deftype`, you copy all methods from the parent. When you `defmethod`, you always set a method in that type. You may also override methods in a child if: the child hasn't modified that method already, and if you are in a certain mode. This is a somewhat slow process that involves iterating over the entire symbol table and every type in the runtime, so I believe it was disabled when loading level code, and you just had to make sure to `deftype` and `defmethod` in order.

Assume you have the type hierarchy where `a` is the parent of `b`, which is the parent of `c`.

If you first define the three types using `deftype`, then override a method from `a` on `c`, then override that same method on `b`, then `c` won't use the override from `b`.

If you first define the three types using `deftype`, then override a method on `b`, it will _sometimes_ do the override on `c`. This depends on the value of the global variable `*enable-method-set*`, and some other confusing options. It may also print a warning but still do the override in certain cases.

# Syntax Basics
An "atom" in Lisp is a form that can't be broken down into smaller forms. For example `1234` is an atom, but `(1234 5678)` is not.  OpenGOAL supports the following atoms:

## Integers
All integers are by default `int`, a signed 64-bit integer. You can use:
- decimal: Like `123` or `-232`. The allowable range is `INT64_MIN` to `INT64_MAX`.
- hex: Like `#x123`. The allowable range is `0` to `UINT64_MAX`. Values over `INT64_MAX` will wrap around.
- binary: Like `#b10101010`. The range is the same as hex.
- character:
  - Most can be written like `#\c` for the character `c`.
  - Space is `#\\s`
  - New Line is `#\\n`
  - Tab is `#\\t`


## String
A string generates a static string constant. Currently the "const" of this string "constant" isn't enforced. Creating two identical string constants creates two different string objects, which is different from GOAL and should be fixed at some point.

The string data is in quotes, like in C. The following escapes are supported:
- Newline: `\n`
- Tab: `\t`
- The `\` character: `\\`
- The `"` character: `\"`
- Any character: `\cXX` where `XX` is the hex number for the character.

## Float
Any number constant with a decimal in it. The trailing and leading zeros and negative sign is flexible, so you can do any of these:
- `1.`, `1.0`, `01.`, `01.0`
- `.1`, `0.1`, `.10`, `0.10`
- `-.1`, `-0.1`, `-.10`, `-0.10`

Like string, it creates a static floating point constant. In later games the float was inlined instead of being a static constant.

## Symbol
Use `symbol-name` to get the value of a symbol and `'symbol-name` to get the symbol object.

## Comments
Use `;` for line comments and `#|` and `|#` for block comments.




# Compiler Forms - Block Related

## `begin`
Execute forms in order.
```lisp
(begin form...)
```
A `begin` form is just a list of other forms which are executed in order. A `begin` form evaluates to the value of the last form.

Example:
```lisp
(begin
  (print "hello ")
  (print "world!")
  7
  )
```
will print `hello world!` and the value of the entire form is `7`.

The `begin` form is used a lot in macros, but not that much in code. It's generally used when you want to execute multiple things, but fit it into a single form.


## `block`
A `block` form is pretty similar to a `begin`, except the `block` has a name. You can then "return" from the block early with `return-from`.
```lisp
(block block-name form...)
```

Example:
```lisp
(block my-block
  (print "hello ")
  (return-from my-block 7)
  (print "world")
  "test"
  )
```
will print `hello ` only and the value of the entire `block` form is `7`.  The type of the `block` is the most specific type that describes all of the possible return values from any `return-from` or from reaching the end (even if its technically not possible to reach the end). In the case above, the possible return types are `int` and `string`, so the return type of the whole block is `object`, the lowest common ancestor type of `int` and `string`.

Block is used rarely, and possibly almost never?

## `return-from`
Exit a `block` or function early. 
```lisp
(return-from block-name value)
```

Looks up the block and exits from it with the value. You can exit out nested blocks. If you are enclosed in multiple blocks with the same name, exits from the inner-most one with a matching name. Everything in a function is wrapped in a block named `#f`, so you can use `(return-from #f x)` to return early from a function with `x`.  When using this form, it may change the return type of the function or block. The return type will be the lowest common ancestor type of all written return paths. If there is an unreachable return path, it will still be considered.

Example
```lisp
(if (is-a-match? x)
  (return-from #f x)
  )
```
if `x` is a match, returns `x` from the function (not shown) immediately.

The `return-from` form is very rarely used to return from a block, but sometimes used to return from a function.

## `label`
Create a named label for `goto` or `goto-when`.
```lisp
(label label-name)
```
The label spaces are per-function and not nested. You can't jump from function to function. You can't jump in or out of functions which end up getting inlined. You can't jump in or out of an anonymous lambda function. You can jump in and out of `let`s.

See `goto` for an example.

Labels are used extremely rarely. Usually only in inline assembly and part of macros for `while` loops and similar.

## `goto`
Jump to a label.
```lisp
(goto label-name)
```
The label must be in the current label space. You can jump forward or backward.

Example:
```lisp
(if skip-code?
  (goto end)
  )

;; code here runs only if skip-code is false.

(label end)
```

The `goto` form used very rarely outside of macros and inline assembly. Try to avoid using `goto`.

## `top-level`
This form is reserved by the compiler. Internally all forms in a file are grouped under a `top-level` form, so you may see this in error messages. Do not name anything `top-level`.

# Compiler Forms - Compiler Commands
These forms are used to control the GOAL compiler, and are usually entered at the GOAL REPL, or as part of a macro that's executed at the GOAL REPL. These shouldn't be used in GOAL source code.

## `seval`
Execute GOOS code.
```lisp
(seval form...)
```
Evaluates the forms in the GOOS macro language. The result is not returned in any way, so it's only useful for getting side effects.  It's not really used other than to bootstrap some GOAL macros for creating macros.

## `asm-file`
Compile a file.
```lisp
(asm-file "file-name" [:color] [:write] [:load] [:no-code])
```
This runs the compiler on a given file. The file path is relative to the `jak-project` folder. These are the options:
- `:color`: run register allocation and code generation. Can be omitted if you don't want actually generate code. Usually you want this option.
- `:write`: write the object file to the `out/obj` folder. You must also have `:color` on. You must do this to include this file in a DGO.
- `:load`: send the object file to the target with the listener. Requires `:color` but not `:write`. There may be issues with `:load`ing very large object files (believed fixed).
- `:disassemble`: prints a disassembly of the code by function.  Currently data is not disassebmled. This code is not linked so references to symbols will have placeholder values like `0xDEADBEEF`.  The IR is printed next to each instruction so you can see what symbol is supposed to be linked. Requires `:color`.
- `:no-code`: checks that the result of processing the file generates no code or data. This will be true if your file contains only macros / constant definition. The `goal-lib.gc` file that is loaded by the compiler automatically when it starts must generate no code. You can use `(asm-file "goal_src/goal-lib.gc" :no-code)` to reload this file and double check that it doesn't generate code.

To reduce typing, there are some useful macros:
- `(m "filename")` is "make" and does a `:color` and `:write`.
- `(ml "filename")` is "make and load" and does a `:color` and `:write` and `:load`. This effectively replaces the previous version of file in the currently running game with the one you just compiled, and is a super useful tool for quick debugging/iterating.
- `(md "filename")` is "make debug" and does a `:color`, `:write`, and `:disassemble`. It is quite useful for working on the compiler and seeing what code is output.
- `(build-game)` does `m` on all game files and rebuilds DGOs
- `(blg)` (build and load game) does `build-game` then sends commands to load KERNEL and GAME CGOs. The load is done through DGO loading, not `:load`ing individual object files.

## `asm-data-file`
Build a data file.
```lisp
(asm-data-file tool-name "file-name")
```
The `tool-name` refers to which data building tool should be used. For example, this should be `game-text` when building the game text data files.  

There's a macro `(build-data)` which rebuilds everything.

## `gs`
Enter a GOOS REPL.
```lisp
(gs)
```
Example:
```
g> (gs)
goos> (+ 1 2 3)
6
goos> (exit)
()
```
mainly useful for debugging/trying things out in GOOS. The GOOS REPL shares its environment with the GOOS interpreter used by the compiler, so you can inspect/modify things for debugging with this. Likely not used much outside of initial debugging.

## `set-config!`
```lisp
(set-config! config-name config-value)
```
Used to set compiler configuration. This is mainly for debugging the compiler and enabling print statements. There is a `(db)` macro which sets all the configuration options for the compiler to print as much debugging info as possible. Not used often.

## `in-package`
```lisp
(in-package stuff...)
```
The compiler ignores this. GOAL files evidently start with this for some reason related to emacs.

## `build-dgos`
```lisp
(build-dgos "path to dgos description file")
```
Builds all the DGO files described in the DGO description file. See `goal_src/builds/dgos.txt` for an example. This just packs existing things into DGOs - you must have already built all the dependencies.

In the future, this may become part of `asm-data-file`.

# Compiler Forms - Control Flow

## GOAL "Two Element" Conditions
These are `!=`, `eq?`, `neq?`, `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.  The default is to compare the two objects as unsigned 64-bit integers, unless a special case is hit. The special case is determined by the type of the __first__ argument:
- Floating point: if second argument is a number, convert to floating point. Use floating point comparisons
- Binteger: convert first argument to integer. If second argument is a number, convert to integer. Use signed integer comparisons
- Integer: If second argument is a number, convert to integer. Use signed integer comparison
- Unsigned Integer: If second argument is a number, convert to integer. Use unsigned integer comparison

Note that comparing structures just checks if they refer to the same memory, not if the contents are the same.

Currently there is absolutely no type checking done on comparisons, which makes it quite easy to get things wrong.

When a two-element condition is used as a condition for an `if`, `cond`, `while`, `goto-when`, or any other branching condition, there is an optimization that avoids computing a GOAL boolean, then checking that GOAL boolean as a branch condition. Instead the comparison operation directly sets the x86-64 flags for a jump. Original GOAL has a similar optimization.

There are a lot of unknown details
- What order are things evaluated / converted?
- How does the order work when there's a `not`?
- Type Checking is probably needed.
- Currently `=` and `eq?` are exactly the same. Likely `=` should only work on numbers and `eq?` should work on references?

## `not`
```lisp
(not value)
```
If value is `#f`, return `#t`. Otherwise return `#f`.

Using `not` on a "two element condition" will be optimized to modifying that condition.

## `when-goto`
```lisp
(when-goto value-or-condition destination)
```
Examples:
```lisp
(when-goto (> x y) some-label)
(when-goto (is-player-dead?) some-label)
```
Jump to `destination` if the condition is truthy (not `#f`).  This ends up generating much better code than `(if condition (goto x))`. 

Like normal `goto`, this isn't used much outside of macros.

## `cond`
A normal Lisp/Scheme `cond`.
```lisp
(cond (test clause...)...)
```
Evaluates `test`s until one is truthy. Then evaluates all `clause`s in that case and returns the value of the last one.  Optionally there can be a case with `else` as the test which runs if no other cases match. This must be the last case.

If there is no `else`, and no cases match, return `#f`. (is it always `#f`?)

The return type is the lowest common ancestor type of all cases.  Note that for a `cond` without `else`, the possible return value of `#f` is __not__ considered when determining the return type. So:
```lisp
(print-type
  (cond (test1 "hi") (test2 "bye"))
  )
```
will print `[TYPE] string`, even though `cond` may return `#f`.

This behavior seems correct if the return value is a `basic`, but less clear if the return value is supposed to be a number.

Note that GOAL will load `#f` into a register for an else case even if the value of the `cond` is never used. Also, even if the value of the `cond` is never used, all cases will store their result into a common `cond` return-register. This is incredibly helpful for the decompiler!

## `if`
A normal Lisp/Scheme `if`.
```lisp
(if test true-case [false-case])
```
The value of the entire statement is the value of the taken case. The false case can be left out. If the condition evaluates to false and the false case is left out, `#f` is returned.  The return type follows the same logic as `cond`, as `if` is a macro using `cond`.

## `when`
A normal Lisp/Scheme `when`.
```lisp
(when test forms...)
```
If `test` is truthy, evaluate all forms and return the value of the last one. If `test` isn't true, return `#f`.

## `unless`
A normal Lisp/Scheme `unless`.
```lisp
(unless test forms...)
```
If `test` is false, evaluate all forms and return the value of the last one. If `test` isn't false, return `#f`.

# Compiler Forms - Definition



## `set!`
Set a value!
```lisp
(set! place value)
```

Sets `place` to `value`. The `place` can be once of:
- A lexical variable defined by `let`, or an argument of a function
- A global symbol
- A `car` or `cdr` of a pair
- A field of an object
- A dereferenced pointer
- An element in an array
- A bitfield within any of the above (not yet implemented)

## `define`
Define a global symbol
```lisp
(define symbol-name value)
```
Kind of like `set!`, but works exclusively on global symbols. Also sets the type of the global symbol. If the global symbol already has a type, and the `define` tries to change it, there will be an error or warning. (to be determined)

## `define-extern`
Inform the compiler about the type of a global symbol
```lisp
(define-extern symbol-name type)
```
Useful to forward declare functions or to let the compiler know about things in the C Kernel. See `goal-externs.gc` for where all the C Kernel stuff is declared.

# Compiler Forms - Functions

## `defun`
Define a new named global function!
```lisp
(defun name arg-list ["doc-string"] body...)
arg-list = (arg...)
arg = (arg-name arg-type)|arg-name
```
Example:
```
(defun 1/ ((x float))
  "Compute 1.0 / x"
  (/ 1.0 x)
  )
```
Define a new function with the given name. Note that until the `defun` itself executes, the function __cannot be used!__. So don't call functions before the `defun`.  This is unlike C, where you can forward declare a function and use it before the actual definition.

There is an optional docstring. Currently the docstring is just thrown away but in the future we could save them and and generate documentation or something.

## `defmethod`
Define a method!
```lisp
(defmethod method-name type-name arg-list ["doc-string"] body...)
```
In many ways is similar to `defun`. See section on methods for more details.

You can only `defmethod` if one of these two is true:
- You are overriding a parent method
- You have declared this method in the type's `deftype`

Like `defun`, the method only exists after the `defmethod` executes. Before that the method may be undefined or the parent's method.

## `inline`
Make this function call inlined.
```
(inline function-name)
```
Example: inline call `my-function`
```
((inline my-function) my-arg)
```
Attempts to make the function call inline. If it is not possible, it will throw an error. You can't save the value of `(inline my-function)`, only use it immediately in a function call. You must provide a name of a global function as the function, not a function pointer.

Methods cannot be inlined. (Maybe new methods can be in original GOAL?)

## `lambda`
Create a GOAL Lambda.
```lisp
(lambda [:name name] [:inline-only #f|#t] [:segment main|debug] arg-list body-form..)
arg-list = (arg...)
arg = (arg-name arg-type)|arg-name
```

The `:name` option is only used for debugging the compiler - it cannot be accessed or referenced outside of internal compiler debugging features. It should be ignored unless you are debugging the compiler.

The `:inline-only` flag defaults to `#f`, but can be set to `#t` to force the compiler to not generate x86-64 code for the function. In this case, the lambda cannot be used as a function pointer/GOAL `function` object.  This is used in the `let` macro and not really useful for general programming.  If the flag is `#f` (default value), it will generate and store an x86-64 function, regardless of if the function is ever called.

The `:segment` option defaults to `main`, unless the `lambda` is defined in a function in the `debug` segment, in which case it defaults to `debug`. It can be overridden by this flag.  This picks the segment of the object file where the function will be stored.

The arguments default to type of `object` if no type is provided.  In the case where a lambda is used immediately (a `let`) the compiler will propagate more specific types. This is why you don't have to give types when using `let`.

A GOAL lambda has three purposes:
1. Generate a function as a "real" x86-64 function.
2. Save the code so the function can later be inlined
3. Immediately use the lambda in the head of a list as part of a `let` or `let*` macro

__Example of 1:__
```
(sort my-list (lambda ((x int) (y int) (< x y))))
```
We create a real x86-64 function to pass to the `sort` function.  In this case you should specify types - the default of `object` is not suitable.

The other two cases are handled by `let` and `defun` macros, and shouldn't show up in other places, so they are left out.

## `declare`
Set options for a function or method
```lisp
(declare [(inline)] [(allow-inline)] [(disallow-inline)] [(asm-func return-typespec)] [(print-asm)])
```
If used, this should be the first thing inside of a `defun`/`defmethod`. Don't use it anywhere else.
Example:
```lisp
(defun my-function ()
  (declare (inline))
  ...
  )
```

- `inline` means "inline whenever possible". See function inlining section for why inlining may be impossible in some cases.
- `allow-inline` or `disallow-inline`. You can control if inlining is allowed, though it is not clear why I thought this would be useful. Currently the default is to allow always.
- `print-asm` if codegen runs on this function (`:color #t`), disassemble the result and print it. This is intended for compiler debugging.
- `asm-func` will disable the prologue and epilogue from being generated. You need to include your own `ret` instruction or similar. The compiler will error if it needs to use the stack for a stack variable or a spilled register. The coloring system will not use callee saved registers and will error if you force it to use one.  As a result, complicated GOAL expression may fail inside an `asm-func` function. The intent is to use it for context switching routines inside in the kernel, where you may not be able to use the stack, or may not want to return with `ret`.  The return type of an `asm-func` must manually be specified as the compiler doesn't automatically put the result in the return register and cannot do type analysis to figure out the real return type.
- `allow-saved-regs` allows an `asm-func`'s coloring to use saved registers without an error. Stacks spills are still an error. The compiler will not automatically put things in a saved register, you must do this yourself. The move eliminator may still be used on your variables which use saved registers, so you should be careful if you really care about where saved variables are used.

This form will probably get more options in the future.

# Compiler Forms - Macro Forms

## `#cond`
This is like an `#ifdef`, but the language for the conditions is GOOS and it's like a `cond`.
```lisp
(#cond (test clause...)...)
```
The `#cond` is executed at compile time. The cases which don't match aren't compiled. There are `#when` and `#unless` macros that work like you would expect.

Example:
```lisp
(#when PRINT_DEBUG_INFO
  (format #t "debug info~%")
  )
```

## `quote` / `'`
The reader will expand `'thing` to `(quote thing)`

```lisp
(quote thing)
```
Currently `quote` supports:
- `'a-symbol` - will return the symbol `a-symbol`
- `'()` - will return the empty list.

In the future, it should support quoted lists of static data.

## `defglobalconstant`
Define a GOOS and GOAL constant.
```lisp
(defconstant name value)
```

The constant is available in both GOOS and GOAL. You can use it in `#cond` expressions (GOOS) and in GOAL code. The constant inserts the `value` as an s-expression in the code. This means it's a "code" constant, and doesn't have a type.

There are a few restrictions:
- Currently constants do not work in `deftype`. (this should be fixed eventually)
- Constants may not work in places where the compiler is expecting a symbol which isn't actually compiled. So `(+ MY_CONSTANT 2)` is fine, but `(defun MY_CONSTANT () ...)` isn't. Don't use constants for type names, function names, or symbol names. It is fine to have a constant with a value of a symbol, but don't `(define MY_CONSTANT)` or `(set! MY_CONSTANT)` or `(new MY_CONSTANT)` or things like that.
- Don't use constants with `method` form.
- You can modify constants created with `defglobalconstant` in GOOS (effect won't be seen in GOAL) with `(set!)`
- There is no warning if one `defglobalconstant` changes the value of an existing `defglobalconstant`

In general constants should have `UPPERCASE` names otherwise things get very confusing when there are name conflicts.

The recommendation is to use constants for things like numbers or expressions like `(* NUM_THINGS SIZE_OF_EACH_THING)`.

## `mlet`
Scoped constants in GOAL. Syntax is like a `let`. This feature has all the restrictions of `defglobalconstant`.
Avoid using `mlet` because it's confusing and not useful.
```lisp
(mlet ((constant-name constant-value)...)
  body...
  )
```

Example:
```lisp
(mlet ((NUM-THINGS 12)
       (THING-NAME "test"))
  ; in here, NUM-THING and THING-NAME are constants
  )
```

# Compiler Forms - Math Forms

Math forms will look at the type of the first argument to determine the "mode".  So if you have `(+ 1 1.2)`, it will convert the `1.2` to an integer, do the add, and return an integer.

## `+`
Addition. Can take 1 or more arguments. `(+ 1)` will give you `1`, like you'd expect.
```lisp
(+ form...)
```
Works on integers and floats. Integer add is 64-bit and wrapping.

## `-`
Subtraction or negative. Can take 1 or more arguments. 
```lisp
(- form...)
```
`(- 1)` gives you `-1`, but `(- 1 3)` gives you `-2`, which may be slightly confusing at first. Works on integers and floats. Integer subtract is 64-bit and wrapping.

## `*`
Multiplication. Can take 1 or more arguments.
```lisp
(* form...)
```
`(* 7)` will become `7`, as you'd expect. Works on integers and floats. The exact behavior for integers needs to be explored more because the EE is weird. GOAL generates different code for multiplication of signed vs. unsigned integers.

## `/`
Division. Takes exactly two arguments
```lisp
(/ dividend divisor)
```
Works on floats and integers. The exact behavior for integers needs to be explored more because the EE is weird. GOAL generates different code for division of signed vs. unsigned integers.

## `mod`
Modulo operation. Takes exactly two arguments.
```lisp
(/ dividend divisor)
```
Works on integers only. The exact behavior needs to be explored because the EE is weird. It is unknown if the same code is generate for signed/unsigned mod.

## `slhv`, `sarv`, `shrv`
```lisp
(shlv value shift-amount)
```
The exact behavior of GOAL shifts isn't fully understood, so these are temporary wrappers around x86-64 variable shift instructions.
- `shlv` shift left variable
- `sarv` shift arithmetic right variable
- `shrv` shift logical right variable
64-bit operation.

## `logand`
Bitwise And
```lisp
(logand a b)
```
64-bit operation.

## `logior`
Bitwise Inclusive Or (normal Or)
```lisp
(logior a b)
```
64-bit operation.

## `logxor`
Bitwise Exclusive Or (Xor
```lisp
(logxor a b)
```
64-bit operation.

## `lognot`
Bitwise Not
```lisp
(lognot a)
```
64-bit operation.

# Compiler Forms - Type Forms

## `defmethod`

## `deftype`


## `method`
Get a method of a type or an object.
__Warning - I will probably change this in the future.__
```
(method type method-name)
(method object method-name)
```

The first form of this takes a type name and method name and returns a GOAL `function` for this method. For example:
```
(method string inspect)
```
will return the `inspect` method of `string`.

The second form of this takes an object and gets the method from it. If the object has runtime type information, will consult the method table to get a possibly more specific method than what is available at compile time. This uses the same lookup logic as method calling - see the section on method calls for more information.

## `car` and `cdr`
Get element from pair
```lisp
(car some-pair)
(cdr some-pair)
```

The type of the result is always `object`, as pairs can hold any `object`. The type-check for `car` and `cdr` is relaxed - it allows it to be applied to any `pair` or `object`.  The reason for allowing `object` is so you can write `(car (car x))` instead of `(car (the pair (car x)))`. However, if the argument to `car` is not a `pair`, you will get garbage or a crash.

## `new`
```lisp
(new [allocation] [new-type-specification] [args]) 
```
See section on creating new GOAL objects. 

## `print-type`
Print the type of some GOAL expression at compile time.
```lisp
(print-type form)
```
This is mainly used to debug the compiler or figure out why some code is failing a type check. The thing inside is actually executed at runtime. Example:
```lisp
(print-type "apples")        ;; [TYPE] string
(print-type (+ 12 1.2))      ;; [TYPE] int
(print-type (the float 12))  ;; [TYPE] float
```

## `the`
Convert between types, doing the expected thing for number conversions.
```lisp
(the type thing)
```

If the `type` and the `thing` are both numbers, it will automatically convert between the different numeric types as needed. In all other cases, it does a dangerous `reinterpret_cast`.  cppreference.com explains this idea clearly with "Converts between types by reinterpreting the underlying bit pattern."

If the `thing` is a number:
- If `type` is `binteger`, convert the number to a `binteger`
- If `type` is `int` or `uint` (or some user-defined child type of these), convert the number to an integer.
- If `type` is `float`, convert the number to a `float`

In all other cases, directly use the 64-bit value in the register as the value of the desired `type`.


Example of number conversions:
```
(the binteger 12) ;; boxed integer for 12
(the float 1)     ;; floating point 1.0
(the int 1.234)   ;; signed integer 1
```

Examples of common casts:
```
(the uint 1)             ;; unsigned integer, doesn't do any modification if input is already an int.
(the (pointer uint8) x)  ;; like C (uint8_t*)x
(the string (car x))     ;; if you know (car x) is a string, do this.
```

Examples of dangerous things you can do but probably shouldn't:
```
(the string 1.234) ;; take the binary representation of 1.234 and treat it as a GOAL memory address to string data.
(the float 'bean)  ;; take the GOAL memory address of the "bean" symbol and treat it as the binary representation of a float.
```

There are some weird edge cases with `the` that are worth mentioning, if you try to set the value of something you've used `the` on. In the future the compiler should block you from doing something bad, but this is not yet implemented.

```
(set! (-> (the (pointer uint8) x)) 1)      ;; OK, not casting the actual value
(set! (the int (-> obj x)) 1)              ;; NOT OK. Int is a value type
;; Will actually work if x is already an int/uint, and with non-numeric values types like pointer.  Avoid just to be safe.
(set! (the string (-> obj x)) "test")      ;; OK, string is a basic, which is a reference type.
```

This becomes more clear if we look at the C equivalent:
```
*(uint8_t*)(a->x) = 1; // makes sense

(int)(a->x) = 1; // doesn't make sense

*(thing*)(a->x) = thing(); // makes sense
```


## `the-as`
Convert between types always using `reinterpret_cast`
```lisp
(the-as type thing)
```
cppreference.com explains this idea clearly with "Converts between types by reinterpreting the underlying bit pattern."

The recommendation is to prefer `the` in almost all cases, unless you want to set an exact bit pattern of a `float`, or want to examine the bits in a `float`.

Example:
```
(the-as int 1.234) ;; result happens to be 1067316150
```

None of the edge cases of `the` apply to `the-as`.


## Pointer Math
Not implemented well yet.

# Compiler Forms - Assembly

## `rlet`
```lisp
(rlet ((var-name [:reg reg-name] [:class reg-class] [:type typespec])...)
  body...
  )
```
Create register variables. You can optionally specify a register with the `:reg` option and a register name like `rax` or `xmm3`. The initial value of the register is not set. If you don't specify a register, a GPR will be chosen for you by the coloring system and it will behave like a `let`.  If you don't specify a register, you can specify a register class (`gpr` or `xmm`) and the compiler will pick a GPR or XMM for you.

If you pick a callee-saved register and use it within the coloring system, the compiler will back it up for you.
If you pick a special register like `rsp`, it won't be backed up.  

Inside the `rlet`, all uses of `var-name` will always be in the given register.  If the variable goes dead (or is never live), the compiler may reuse the register as it wants.  The compiler may also spill the variable onto the stack.  Of course, if you are in an `asm-func`, the stack will never be used.

Here is an example of using an `rlet` to access registers:
```lisp
(defun get-goal-rsp-2 ()
  "Get the stack pointer as a GOAL pointer"
  (rlet ((rsp :reg rsp :type uint)
         (off :reg r15 :type uint))
        (the pointer (- rsp off))
        )
  )
```

## General assembly forms
In general, assembly forms have a name that begins with a `.`. They all evaluate to `none` and copy the form of an x86-64 instruction. For example `(.sub dst src)`. A destination must be a settable register (ok if it's spilled). So you can't do something like `(.sub (-> obj field) x)`. Instead, do `(set! temp (-> obj field))`, `(.sub temp x)`, `(set! (-> obj field) temp)`.   The sources can be any expression.

By default, assembly forms work with the coloring system. This means that assembly and high level expression can be mixed together without clobbering each other. It also means use of callee-saved registers will cause them to be backed up/restored in the function prologue and epilogue.  Use of weird registers like `r15`, `r14`, and `rsp` works as you would expect with the coloring system. 
 
But you can also request to skip this with `:color #f` option, like `(.push my-reg-var :color #f)`. Be very careful with this. The `:color #f` option will only work with register variables from `rlet` which have a manually specified register. It will entirely bypass the coloring system and use this register. Use of this with other GOAL code is extremely dangerous and should be done very carefully or avoided.

## `.sub`
```lisp
(.sub dest src [:color #t|#f])
```
x86-64 subtraction. If coloring is on (the default), the `dest` must be a settable register (`rlet` var, `let` var, function argument, ...). It can't be a place like a symbol, field, stack variable, etc.  If coloring is off, both `src` and `dest` must be registers defined and constrained in an enclosing `rlet`.

Example:
```
(defun get-goal-rsp ()
  (declare (asm-func uint))
  (rlet ((rsp :reg rsp :type uint)
         (off :reg r15 :type uint)
         (ret :reg rax :type uint)
         )
        
        ;; mov rax, rsp
        (set! ret rsp)
        ;; sub rax, r15
        (.sub ret off)
        ;; ret
        (.ret)
        )
  )
```

## `.push`
```lisp
(.push src [:color #t|#f])
```

The x86-64 push instruction. Does a 64-bit GPR.  The `src` can be any expression if color is on. Otherwise it must be a register defined and constrained in an enclosing `rlet`.

## `.pop`
```lisp
(.pop dst [:color #t|#f])
```

The x86-64 pop instruction.  Does a 64-bit GPR. The `dst` can be any settable register if color is on. Otherwise it must be a register defined and constrained in an enclosing `rlet`.

## `.ret`
```lisp
(.ret [:color #t|#f])
```

The x86-64 ret instruction. The color option does nothing. This is not recognized as a control flow instruction by the coloring system.


# Compiler Forms - Unsorted

## `let`
```lisp
(let ((var-name value)...) body...)
```
Define local variables. The variables are automatically assigned a type, like C++ `auto`.

Example:
```lisp
(let ((count-1 (+ a b))   ;; count_1 = a + b
      (count-2 (+ c d)))  ;; count_2 = c + d
  (if (count > 10)
    ;; print a message if count > 10.
    (format #t "count = ~D, ~D~%" count-1 count-2)
    )    
  )
```

Note, if you define multiple variables in a `let`, you cannot refer to variables defined previously in the same `let`.  In the example above, `count-2`'s value couldn't be defined in terms of `count-1` for example.  See `let*`.

## `let*`
```lisp
(let ((var-name value)...) body...)
```

Define local variables. If you define multiple in a single `let*`, you can refer to previous variables.

Example:
```lisp
(let* ((count-1 (+ a b))
       (count-2 (+ count-1 d)))  ;; okay because we used let*
  (if (count > 10)
    ;; print a message if count > 10.
    (format #t "count = ~D, ~D~%" count-1 count-2)
    )    
  )
```

# Compiler Features

## Compiling a list
When the compiler encounters a list like `(a b c)` it attempts to parse in multiple ways in this order:
1. A compiler form
2. A GOOS macro
3. An enum (not yet implemented)
4. A function or method call

## Compiling an integer
Integers can be specified as
- decimal: `1` or `-1234` (range of `INT64_MIN` to `INT64_MAX`)
- hex: `#x123`, `#xbeef` (range of `0` to `UINT64_MAX`)
- binary: `#b101010` (range of `0` to `UINT64_MAX`)

All integers are converted to the signed "integer in variable" type called `int`, regardless of how they are specified.
Integer "constant"s are not stored in memory but instead are generated by code, so there's no way to modify them.

## Compiling a string
A string constant can be specified by just putting it in quotes. Like `"this is a string constant"`.
There is an escape code `\` for string:
- `\n` newline
- `\t` tab character
- `\\` the `\` character
- `\"` the `"` character
- `\cXX` where `XX` is a two character hex number: insert this character.
- Any other character following a `\` is an error.

OpenGOAL stores strings in the same segment of the function which uses the string. I believe GOAL does the same. 

In GOAL, string constants are pooled per object file (or perhaps per segment)- if the same string appears twice, it is only included once. OpenGOAL currently does not pool strings. If any code is found that modifies a string "constant", or if repeated strings take up too much memory, string pooling will be added.  

For now I will assume that string constants are never modified.


## Compiling a float
A floating point constant is distinguished from an integer by a decimal point. Leading/trailing zeros are optional. Examples of floats: `1.0, 1., .1, -.1, -0.2`.  Floats are stored in memory, so it may be possible to modify a float constant. For now I will assume that float constants are never modified. It is unknown if they are pooled like strings.

Trivia: Jak 2 realized that it's faster to store floats inline in the code.

## Compiling a symbol
A `symbol` appearing in code is compiled by trying each of these in the following order
1. Is it `none`? (see section on `none`)
2. Try `mlet` symbols
3. Try "lexical" variables (defined in `let`)
4. Try global constants
5. Try global variables (includes named functions and all types)

## The Special `none` type
Anything which doesn't return anything has a return type of `none`, indicating the return value can't be used.  This is similar to C's `void`.

## GOAL Structs vs. C Structs
There is one significant difference between C and GOAL when it comes to structs/classes - GOAL variables can only be references to structs.

As an example, consider a GOAL type `my-type` and a C type `my_type`.  In C/C++, a variable of type `my_type` represents an entire copy of a `my_type` object, and a `my_type*` is like a reference to an existing `my_type` object.  In GOAL, an object of `my-type` is a reference to an existing `my-type` object, like a C `my_type*`.  There is no equivalent to a C/C++ `my_type`.

As a result you cannot pass or return a structure by value.

Another way to explain this is that GOAL structures (including `pair`) always have reference semantics.  All other GOAL types have value semantics.

## Pointers
GOAL pointers work a lot like C/C++ pointers, but have some slight differences:
- A C `int32_t*` is a GOAL `(pointer int32)`
- A C `void*` is a GOAL `pointer`
- In C, if `x` is a `int32_t*`, `x + 1` is equivalent to `uintptr_t(x) + sizeof(int32_t)`.  In GOAL, all pointer math is done in units of bytes.
- In C, you can't do pointer math on a `void*`. In GOAL you can, and all math is done in units of bytes.

In both C and GOAL, there is a connection between arrays and pointers.  A GOAL array field will have a pointer-to-element type, and a pointer can be accessed as an array.

One confusing thing is that a `(pointer int32)` is a C `int32_t*`, but a `(pointer my-structure-type)` is a C `my_structure_type**`, because a GOAL `my-structure-type` is like a C `my_structure_type*`.

## Inline Arrays
One limitation of the system above is that an array of `my_structure_type` is actually an array of references to structures (C `object*[]`).  It would be more efficient if instead we had an array of structures, laid out together in memory (C `object[]`).  

GOAL has a "inline array" to represent this.  A GOAL `(inline-array thing)` is like a C `thing[]`. The inline-array can only be used on structure types, as these are the only reference types.


## Fields in Structs
For a field with a reference type (structure/basic)
- `(data thing)` is like C `Thing* data;`
- `(data thing :inline #t)` is like C `Thing data;`
- `(data thing 12)` is like C `Thing* data[12];`. The field has `(pointer thing)` type.
- `(data thing 12 :inline #t)` is like `Thing data[12];`. The field has `(inline-array thing)` type

For a field with a value type (integer, etc)
- `(data int32)` is like C `int32_t data;`
- `(data int32 12)` is like `int32_t data[12];`. The field has `(array int32)` type.

Using the `:inline #t` option on a value type is not allowed.

## Dynamic Structs
GOAL structure can be dynamically sized, which means their size isn't determined at compile time. Instead the user should implement `asize-of` to return the actual size. 

This works by having the structure end in an array of unknown size at compile time. In a dynamic structure definition, the last field of the struct should be an array with an unspecified size. To create this, add a `:dynamic #t` option to the field and do not specify an array size.  This can be an array of value types, an array of reference types, or an inline-array of reference types.

### Unknown
Is the `size` of a dynamic struct:
- size assuming the dynamic array has 0 elements (I think it's this)
- size assuming the dynamic array doesn't 

These can differ by padding for alignment.

## New - How To Create GOAL Objects
GOAL has several different ways to create objects, all using the `new` form.

### Heap Allocated Objects
A new object can be allocated on a heap with `(new 'global 'obj-type [new-method-arguments])`.
This simply calls the `new` method of the given type. You can also replace `'global` with `'debug` to allocate on the debug heap.
Currently these are the only two heaps supported, in the future you will be able to call the new method with other arguments
to allow you to do an "in place new" or allocate on a different heap.

This will only work on structures and basics. If you want a heap allocated float/integer/pointer, create an array of size 1.
This will work on dynamically sized items.

### Heap Allocated Arrays
You can construct a heap array with `(new 'global 'inline-array 'obj-type count)` or `(new 'global 'array 'obj-type count)`.
These objects are not initialized. Note that the `array` version creates a `(pointer obj-type)` plain array, 
__not__ a GOAL `array` type fancy array.  In the future this may change because it is confusing.

Because these objects are uninitialized, you cannot provide constructor arguments.
You cannot use this on dynamically sized member types. However, the array size can be determined at runtime.

### Static Objects
You can create a static object with `(new 'static 'obj-type [field-def]...)`. For now it must be a structure or basic.
Each field def looks like `:field-name field-value`. The `field-value` is evaluated at compile time. For now, fields
can only be integers, floats, or symbols.

Fields which aren't explicitly initialized are zeroed, except for the type field of basics, which is properly initialized to the correct type.

This does not work on dynamically sized structures.

### Stack Allocated Arrays
Currently only arrays of integers, floats, or pointers can be stack allocated.
For example, use `(new 'stack ''array 'int32 1)` to get a `(pointer int32)`. Unlike heap allocated arrays, these stack arrays
must have a size that can be determined at compile time.  The objects are uninitialized.

### Stack Allocated Structures
Works like heap allocated, the objects are initialized with the constructor. The constructor must support "stack mode". Using `object-new` supports stack mode so usually you don't have to worry about this.  The structure's memory will be memset to 0 with `object-new` automatically.

## Defining a `new` Method

## Integer Type
GOAL has some weird behavior when it comes to integers. It may seem complicated to describe, but it really makes the implementation simpler - the integer types are designed around the available MIPS instructions.

Integers that are used as local variables (defined with `let`), function arguments, function return values, and intermediate values when combining these are called "register integers", as the values will be stored in CPU registers. 

Integers that are stored in memory as a field of a `structure`/`basic`, an element in an array, or accessed through a `pointer` are "memory integers", as the values will need to be loaded/stored from memory to access them.

The "register integer" types are `int` and `uint`. They are 64-bit and mostly work exactly like you'd expect. Multiplication, division, and mod, are a little weird and are documented separately.

The "memory integer" types are `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, and `uint64`.

Conversions between these types are completely automatic - as soon as you access a "memory integer", it will be converted to a "register integer", and trying to store a "register integer" will automatically convert it to the appropriate "memory integer". It (should be) impossible to accidentally get this wrong.

### Side Note
- It's not clear what types `(new 'static 'integer)` or `(new 'stack 'integer)` are, though I would assume both are memory.

- If there aren't enough hardware registers, "register integers" can be spilled to stack, but keep their "register integer" types. This process should be impossible to notice, so you don't have to worry about it.

## Array Spacing
In general, all GOAL objects are 16-byte aligned and the boxing system requires this.  All heap memory allocations are 16-byte aligned too, so this is usually not an issue.  

## Truth
Everything is true except for `#f`. This means `0` is true, and `'()` is true.
The value of `#f` can be used like `nullptr`, at least for any `basic` object.  It's unclear if `#f` can/should be used as a null for other types, including `structure`s or numbers or pointers.

Technical note: the hex number `0x147d24` is considered false in Jak 1 NTSC due to where the symbol table happened to be allocated.  However, checking numbers for true/false shouldn't be done, you should use `(zero? x)` instead.

## Empty Pair

# Built-in Types

## `structure`
A structure is the parent type of all types with fields.

## `basic`
A basic is a structure with runtime type information. The first field is named `type` and contains the `type` of the basic.

# Implemented in Runtime Language Functions

## `string->symbol`

## `symbol->string`

## `format`
GOAL's `printf`.
```lisp
(format destination format-string args...)
```

The following destinations are currently supported:
- `#t` - print to the listener. After the current game frame is over, this will be sent to the compiler and you can see it at the GOAL prompt.
- `0` - print to `stdout` in the runtime immediately. This won't be visible from within the compiler - you must look at the runtime to see it.  This is useful for debugging if the runtime crashes before flushing the normal print buffer.
- `#f` - print to a new string allocated on the global heap.
- a GOAL `string` object - append to an existing string
- a GOAL `file-stream` object - currently unsupported but eventually may allow printing into a file somewhere

The global variable `*print-column*` can be used to automatically print at a certain indentation.  The very first thing printed during a frame will not have the indentation applied.

The format string escape sequences all start with `~`, then have arguments (possibly none), then have a single character code.  The arguments look like:
- `~A`, the `A` code with no arguments
- `~12A`, the `A` code with an integer argument of `12`
- `~'zA`, the `A` code with a character argument of `z`
- ``` ~`hello`A```, the `A` code with a string argument of `"hello"`
- `~12,'bA`, the `A` code with two arguments, integer `12` and character `b`


The escape codes are

### `~%`
Replace with a newline character.

### `~~`
Replace with a `~` character

### `~G` or `~g`
Replace with a C-style string given in `args`. Note that this will not work on a GOAL string.

### `~A` or `~a`
Print a boxed object given in `args`. Uses the `print` method. Can take optional arguments for length and padding character. If the `print` method gives something shorter than the length argument, it will be padded on the left with the padding character (default is space).  If the `print` method gives something too long, it will be truncated on the right. The last character printed will be changed to `~` to indicate it was truncated here.

There is an option to left justify instead but I don't think there's a way to turn it on.

### `~S` or `~s`
Very similar to `~A`, but a GOAL string will be printed without quotes around it.

### `~C` or `~c`
Print a single character (GOAL `uint8` or `int8` type)

### `~P` or `~p`
Print an object, similar to `~A`, but does not have optional arguments for length or padding. Instead, there is an optional argument to give a type name, then use that types `print` method.  This is useful for printing non-boxed objects. If no type name is given, behaves like `~A`.

### `~I` or `~i`
Like `~P`, but uses the inspect method instead.

### `~Q` or `~q`
Likely was supposed to be for printing 128-bit integers stored in registers, but will always prints `0`.  The `format` function is written in C using varargs, which doesn't support 128-bit register values.

### `~B` or `~b`
Print integer as binary. Optional arguments for pad-length and pad-character (default is 0). Won't truncate.

### `~D` or `~d`
Print integer as decimal (signed). Optional arguments for pad-length and pad-character (default is space). Won't truncate.

### `~X` or `~x`
Print integer as hex. Optional arguments for pad-length and pad-character (default is 0). Won't truncate.

### `~F`
Print floating point. Will print 4 digits after the decimal and pad with space to a width of 12 and does not accept any options.

### `~f`
Print floating point.  Takes optional arguments for pad-length (default don't pad), pad-character (default space), and precision (default 4).

## `~R` or `~r`
Like `~f` but scales in-game rotation units to degrees.  The float `65536.0` is 360 degrees.

### `~M` or `~m`
Like `~f` but scales in-game distance units to meters.  The float `4096.0` is 1 meter.

### `~E` or `~e`
Like `~f` for argument, but takes an integer time-code as an input and scales time-code units to seconds.  There are 300 ticks / second, which is the smallest number which has an integer number of ticks per NTSC and PAL frame.  Something very weird happens when the input is negative?

### `~T` or `~t`
Insert a tab character.

### Pass Through Codes
Some codes will be passed through automatically, along with any arguments.  This will also pass through arguments of `+` or `-`.  I believe that these options could later be interpreted by the code for printing on-screen characters.

The pass through codes are `H,J,K,L,N,V,W,Y,Z,h,j,k,l,n,v,w,y,z`.

Any other codes will result in an error message being printed.
