 *
 * From my current understanding, we can get away with this and just sync everything on vsync.
 * However, there are two calls to this per frame.
 *
 * But I don't fully understand why they call sceGsSyncPath where they do (right before depth cue)
 * so maybe the depth cue looks at the z-buffer of the last rendered frame when setting up the dma
 * for the next frame?  The debug drawing also happens after this.
 *
 * The second call is right before swapping buffers/vsync, so that makes sense.
