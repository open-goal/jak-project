SECTION .TEXT

;; This _format function which will be exported to the GOAL symbol table at runtime start as "_format"
;; This function accepts 8 GOAL arguments and puts them on the stack, then calls format_impl and passes
;; a pointer to this array of GOAL arguments as the argument. The reason for this is that GOAL and
;; the standard System V ABI used in Linux are different for 8 argument function calls.

;; - address of function to call
;; - address of the symbol table
;; - GOAL memory space offset
