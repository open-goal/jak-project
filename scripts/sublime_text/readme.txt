move the goal.sublime-syntax file to your Packages/User directory.  To find this, you can go to Preferences -> Browse Packages -> User.

To enable the syntax highlighting, set the language to goal. It should show up in the "User" category.

For formatting, install the lispindent plugin and move the lispindent config file to the same User folder.
