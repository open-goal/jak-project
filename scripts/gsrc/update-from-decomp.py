# Updates a gsrc file from it's respective decompiled output
# Tries it's very best to:
# - retain all comments (100% of them)
# - place them in either the exact same spot, or roughly the same spot
# - retain decomp deviations (marked with ;; decomp deviation comment guards) and try to place them back
#   - this will also automate the process of knowing if a file was modified or not if actually used
#
# This is done with a variety of heuristics and can obviously only be so
# accurate on unstructured data like code
#
# Assumes this is ran from the root dir of the repository

# Overview of the process:
# - Collect all comments, associate as much metadata with them as possible so we can reposition them in the new output
# - Potential metadata that will help (from most to least accurate)
#   - symbol it is directly before/after (symbol names don't change, so this is VERY accurate (ie. a function name / type name))
#   - forms/variable names it is directly before/after (these may change, might be the whole reason you are decompiling again!)
#   - line number into a form (may also change, but independent of output)
#   - containing form (if all else fails, we can atleast put it _near_ where it should go)
# Update the decompilation
# Attempt to add back all of the comment lines
# - adjust indentation if needed
#
# 1. Get metadata from original file so we can reconstruct it
# 2. Cleanup disasm file (get rid of most comments, etc)
# 3. Add back all comment blocks to modified original file
# 4. hope for the best...

# Known Issues:
# - use defuns as symbols (consistent names), but account for padding properly
# - padding after decomp deviation blocks / blocks in general is wrong
# - blocks starting inline (ie '(define foo 'bar) #|start of a block comment that continues on...)
# - decomp deviation blocks inside forms can cause paren counting issues
# -
# - codes a mess, as one would probably expect for something as miserable as this, it needs a refactor
# - there are likely ways to make this more efficient
