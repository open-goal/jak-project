;; sorry - this file has a lot of inline modifiations/comments.
;; it's probably better to update this one manually!

;; The "joint" system is used to play back animations.
;; At a very high level, the process to animate a character:
;;  - the gameplay code uses the `ja` macros to set up joint animations.
;;  - the process-drawable system updates the animation metadata in joint-control. This is responsible for
;;    producing an array of joint-control-channel. The channels are arranged into a blend tree, and each
;;    channel has a frame number (possibly in between frames) and interpolation weight for the blend tree.
;; - This file, joint.gc looks at those animations, frame numbers, blend weights, and tree structure, then
;;   produces the relative transform between bones, called "joint transforms"
;; - The process-drawable system uses the joint transforms to compute bone transforms.
;; - The gameplay code and collision code use the bone transforms to determine world-space positions/rotations.
;; - The "bones.gc" system builds rendering matrices for the foreground renderer
;; - The merc, mercneric, and shadow renderers consume these matrices for their skinning calculations.

;; --- Joint, bone, and cspace ---

;; A "bone" is simply the world space transformation of a character's bone.
;; These "bones" are eventually used to position collision geometry, and compute the skinning matrices for rendering.
;; Note that bones matrices can include per-axis scaling too, to allow animated characters to appear squashed/stretched.

;; "joint" refers the parent-child relation of bones. Like a real skeleton, moving one bone will cause all the
;; bones "below" it in the tree to move too.  The "joint transform" refers to the relative transformation between bones.
;; The actual "joint" type is a node in this tree, and simply stores name/indexing information. (it also stores the mesh bind pose,
;; but this is _not_ used at all by the joint system - only renderers! the bind-pose is a property of the meshes and how they are exported,
;; not the actual skeleton/bone locations.

;; "cspace" is a mysterious term. There is a cspace for each bone, and it tells you how to control the bone.
;; By default, the bone is controlled from the animation, in the normal way. It is possible to override this
;; by providing your own callback. This might modify the animation (for example, scale something for big-head mode, mirror something)
;; or completely override it (for example, adjust the transformation to move some disconnected part of a character, spin
;; the propeller on a zoomer).
;; The joint-mod system internally sets the cspace to apply modifications to a joint.

;; the cspace stores a reference to the bone, and often times the game will just pass around the cspace in places
;; where they just want the bone.

;; Note on the cspace bone matrix: when extracting the translation, they use vector<-cspace!, which divides by the w,w component...
;; I have no idea why this is done. It happens in all 3 games. It seems like this value is almost exactly 1 in all cases.

;; ---- Compression and streaming ----
;; Animations from cutscenes are streamed in chunks. This chunking happens a level above this file, and this file just
;; sees short, several second long animations.

;; Animations for jak (walking, jumping, etc) are not streamed since there would be too much latency to wait for the DVD drive.
;; Some of these animations are wrapped in LZO compression. This requires decompressing the entire animation to access it.
;; To avoid redoing the LZO compression on every frame, there is a LZO animation decompression cache. Ideally, the animation
;; is decompressed once on the first frame its used, then remains in the cache while it's in use.

;; Additionally, all animations have their own inner compression format. This format is designed for speed and ease of decompression,
;; and is designed so you can seek to an arbitrary frame. The decompressor is stateless - if frame n + 1 is decompressed after frame n,
;; there is no benefit or reused information.

;; ---- Blending animations ----
;; Multiple animations are played at the same time, using a tree structure. Each animation runs on a separate "channel".
;; There are a few different ways this is specified in gameplay code. The most common way is simply using `ja-channel-push!` calls.

;; The tree operates as a stack machine, consisting of push, blend, and stack operations.
;; The "push" operation creates a new entry on the stack, consisting of an animation.
;; The "blend" operation blends against the last thing on the stack.
;; The "stack" operation adds together the last two things, with the given weight.

;; This is best observed with an example:
;; PUSH(A)
;;   a = 1
;; BLEND(B, 0.5)
;;   a = 0.5, b = 0.5
;; PUSH(C)
;;   a = 0.5, b = 0.5
;;   c = 1.0
;; STACK(0.25)
;;   a = 0.125, b = 0.125, c = 0.75

;; ---- Stack1 and Push1 ----

;; There are two strange operations: stack1 and push1.
;; My current understanding is that this is simply an optimization.
;; Basically, if the last two joint channels are a "push", then "stack", it is effectively blending "everything before these"
;; with "this last pushed channel".

;; In this case, the engine will set these to push1 and stack1. The "push1" behaves like a blend, and the stack1 is ignored.
;; This has the same behavior, but two advantages: it is okay to completely ignore the stack1, and it reduces the stack depth by one.

;; with our example

;; PUSH(A)
;;   a = 1
;; BLEND(B, 0.5)
;;   a = 0.5, b = 0.5
;; PUSH1(C, 0.25) ;; note: this needs the weight!
;;   a = 0.125, b = 0.125, c = 0.75
;; STACK1(0.25)   ;; does nothing, can be left out.
;;   a = 0.125, b = 0.125, c = 0.75

;; You might wonder: why both having push1/stack1? Couldn't the code doing animation just request a `blend`,
;; and then we wouldn't have to special-case push1/stack1 here?
;; The reason is probably the no-push feature below

;; ---- no-push -----
;; if "no-push" mode is active, then the stack machine acts like "pushing" just overwrites the top of the stack, and
;; stacking does nothing

;; PUSH(A)
;;   a = 1
;; BLEND(B, 0.5)
;;   a = 0.5, b = 0.5
;; PUSH(C)
;;   c = 1.0
;; STACK(0.25)
;;   c = 1.0

;; however, the actual implementation is that pushes work as normal, and stacking always takes the most recent.

;; PUSH(A)
;;   a = 1
;; BLEND(B, 0.5)
;;   a = 0.5, b = 0.5
;; PUSH(C)
;;   a = 0.5, b = 0.5
;;   c = 1.0
;; STACK(0.25) ;; the weight is ignored
;;   c = 1.0

;; and, in no-push mode, the push1/stack1 _don't_ act like a blend! and the implementation is so you can
;; skip the stack1 entirely.

;; PUSH(A)
;;   a = 1
;; BLEND(B, 0.5)
;;   a = 0.5, b = 0.5
;; PUSH1(C, 0.25) ;; note: weight is ignored
;;   c = 1.0
;; STACK1(0.25)   ;; does nothing, can be left out.
;;   c = 1.0

;; (note: no-push mode is only supported by the matrix-from-control! function
;;  which is used to implement cspace<-matrix-no-push-joint!, which grabs a single joint's matrix
;;  for the aligner - more on this later.)

;; ---- Interp2 mode ----
;; Jak 2 introduced a new interpolation system, which runs on top of the blending system described above.
;; They key feature of this new system is that it can mask animations per joint. For example, they apply "gun" animations
;; only to the upper body of jak, while keeping the lower body animated normally. Some joints in the middle of jak are a blend
;; of the two.
;; The important part is that this runs at the joint transform level, not the bone tranform level.
;; Internally, this works by running the entire animation system twice, then blending the joint transform results.

;; --- The first three cspaces/bones ---
;; (this is how it gets set up by default. individual actors can always override.)

;; The first cspace is a special one without a joint. It is "root", and is simply a copy of the actors "root" position.
;; This is what makes all animations relative to the actor's position. There's no joint for this.

;; The second cspace is the "align" cspace. This joint is an animated matrix rather than a transformq.
;; This is used to move the process drawable root. Why would you want to do that? It means the an animation actually moves
;; the process, so if the animation is cancelled, the actor stays in the same spot. The aligner also populates the transv
;; (velocity) based on the speed of the align, so you can use accurate velocities in physics/collision queries.

;; The third cspace is the "prejoint" cspace. This is always the parent of all bones which are associated with meshes.
;; So you can modify the prejoint to move the entire visible actor (without moving the process root trans).
;; Like the second cpsace, it is an animated matrix rather than a transformq.

;; All other joints are animated transformqs, but I'm not sure why.

;; ---- Inner decompression format ----

;; The compressed format is relatively simple.
;; There is a "fixed" data for an entire animation, and "frame data": one for each frame.
;; Each data has some u64's, u32's, and u16's.

;; For the two matrix joints, there is a bit which indicates if the matrix is varying. If so, the matrix is stored
;; in the frame data (so there is a different matrix for each frame), and if not, it is stored in the fixed data (one
;; matrix for the entire animation).

;; For the transformq joints, there are 4-bits of "control" per joint, stored in the control-bits array (packed)
;; the first bit indicates if the trans is varying, quat is varying, scale is varying, and the format of the trans.
;; If the data is varying, it can be found in the frame data, otherwise it is in the fixed data.

;; If the trans format bit is not set, the trans is stored as int16's. The x, y are stored in a single u32, and the z
;; is stored in a single u16. (the reason for this is to avoid unaligned loads and ps2 instruction specific optimization)
;; The trans should be multiplied by 4 to get meters.

;; If the trans format bit is set, the trans is stored as floats. The x, y are stored in a single u64, and the z is
;; stored in a single u32. There is no scaling or int/float conversion needed.

;; The quaternion is stored as 4 int16's packed into a single u64. The value should be divided by 32768.
;; Note that the decompressor handles "flipped" quaternions (all elements multiplied by -1) in interpolation so there should
;; be no assumptions about the quaternion convention of animations (of both the compressed data, and the output of the decompressor)

;; The scale is stored as 3 int16's. The x, y are stored in a single u32, and the z is stored in a single u16.
;; The scale should be divided by 4096.
