(deftype drawable-tree (drawable-group)
  "A drawable tree is a container of drawables of a specific rendering type.
Instead of having a single large tree of mixed types, there will be a tree of tfrags, a tree of ties, etc.
The top-level tfrag tree will have a type that's a child of drawable-tree.
Generally, the object passed to a large renderer is a drawable-tree."
