(deftype transform (structure)
  "Transformation. w components of vectors should be 1.0
This can represent any rotation, translation, and scaling.
Note that the scaling is applied before rotation
(meaning it scales along the axes of the pre-transformed frame)."

(deftype trs (basic)
  "Like transform, but it's a basic.
Note that the trsq child type overrides this rotation with a quaternion.
usage of the plain trs is very limited, at least in Jak 1."
