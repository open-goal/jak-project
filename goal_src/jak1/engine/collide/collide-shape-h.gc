;; What is collide-shape?
;;  A collide shape is a group of collision geometry. Typically, each actor will have a single collide shape.
;;  Each collide shape may contain a number of collide-shape-prim's.

;; There are subclasses of collide-shape-prim for different types of collision primitives.
;; The types are:
;;  - mesh. A foreground collision mesh. This has a fixed max size, so something have multiple meshes.
;;  - group. A list of other prims.
;;  - sphere. A sphere.

;; The non-sphere classes also store a bsphere that must contain all collision geometry.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; New vs. Old Collide System
;; There are, effectively, two systems for collision queries.

;; Things that are shared:
;; Both systems use "collide-shape".
;; Both systems track foreground collision objects through the lists:
;;  - collide-player-list
;;  - collide-hit-by-player-list
;;  - collide-usually-hit-by-player-list

;; The "old" system:
;;  - generally uses recursive traversals through the collide shape tree
;;  - uses "collide-mesh-cache".
;;  - can't collide with water or the background.

;; The "new" system:
;;  - is the only way to collide with the background/water
;;  - uses "collide-cache"
;;  - generally dumps stuff into the collide-cache, then uses collide-cache functions
;;  - does not support a few of the weirder collision checks

;; There is some duplicate implemenations because both the new and old system collide
;; foreground meshes. The new system can just import foreground collision meshes
;; into its collide cache.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; Collision queries:

;; Push Away.
;; Some objects move on fixed paths (like platforms).  When these move forward, they should "push away"
;; things they hit (generally, Jak).  Push Away only works between foreground objects and uses the old system.
;; The do-push-aways! function should be called after moving a shape to push away things that you hit.
;; Internally, this uses things called SPAT/should-push-away-test.
;; The push-aways use the collide resolve system (described below) to actually push things aways
;; (you can't push-away something through a wall, for example.)

;; Collide Resolve. (made up name)
;; Some objects (like Jak) do not move on fixed paths, and will be stopped by walls or other obstacles.
;; This works on background and foreground objects, and uses the new system (it must, to handle background).
;; The fill-cache-integrate-and-collide! function should be called, which will fill the collide cache
;; and then do an iterative collision algorithm.
;; This will call the reaction function. The default "default-collision-reaction" function is in collide-shape.gc
;; will fill the touching list.

;; Nav Enemy Collision (made up name)
;; collide-shape-moving-method-58 and integrate-for-enemy-with-move-to-ground are nav-enemy specific.
;; the details aren't super well understood yet. But they basically try to go forward if they aren't blocked.
;; Uses find-overlapping-shapes as the detector. (old system)

;; Move To Ground.
;; move-to-ground. Does what it says. (new system)

;; detect-riders
;; for platforms, detect if somebody is on the platform. (on-platform-test)
;; uses old system. Sends event adds to rider list.
