;; Note that it doesn't always make sense to call all of these methods on all types,
;; and that certain methods should only be called at certain times, and may require coordination
;; with having certain VU0 or scratchpad data present.
;; In many cases, "draw" simply adds data to a buffer that must later be converted to dma in finish-background
;; or similar.  Or just does nothing.
