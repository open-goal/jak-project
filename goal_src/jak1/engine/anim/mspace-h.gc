;; DECOMP BEGINS

;; this file contains types for the skeletal animation system.
;; the "bones" are the actual matrix data consumed by the renderers.
;; the "joints" describe how bones are connected.
;; a "cspace" links together a bone, joint, and a way to control the joint (and bone)

;; There's three main container types:
;; - The cspace-array.  This contains references to the bones and the joints. (called node-list)
;; - The skeleton: This is an inline array of bones. (called skeleton)
;; - The joint-control (not in this file): this has the logic for running joint animations. (called skel)

;; First, the joint. This type just describes how the skeleton is connected and the bind pose.
(deftype joint (basic)
  ((name      string)
   (number    int32)
   (parent    joint)
   (bind-pose matrix :inline)))

;; I believe this stores offsets, in bytes, of where there are stored
;; (possibly in the scratchpad)
(deftype bone-cache (structure)
  ((bone-matrix   uint32)
   (parent-matrix uint32)
   (dummy         uint32)
   (frame         uint32)))

;; The "bone" stores the final positions of the bodies.
;; This is a world space transform.
(deftype bone (structure)
  ((transform matrix :inline)
   (position  vector :inline :overlay-at (-> transform vector 3))
   (scale     vector :inline)
   (cache     bone-cache :inline)))

;; Like a real skeleton, this is a collection of bones for a single character.
(deftype skeleton (inline-array-class)
  ((bones bone :inline :dynamic)))

(set! (-> skeleton heap-base) (the-as uint 96))

;; The "cspace" seems to be a system for linking bones and joints.
;; The tree structure matches the tree of joints.
;; For example: (-> *target* node-list data 14 parent joint) is the same as
;;              (-> *target* node-list data 14 joint parent)
;; But, we appear to use bone indices here.
;; So the joint index is always 1 less than the node index.
;; By convention, node 0 is not a joint.
;;                node 1 is an "align" joint. It has parent #f, and is joint 0.
;;                node 2 is a "prejoint". It also has parent #f, and is joint 1.
;;                node 3 is "main". It has parent prejoint, and is joint 2.
;;                node 4 is the first real joint (for jak, it's upper body).
