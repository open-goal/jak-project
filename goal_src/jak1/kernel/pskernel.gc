pskernel.gc contains a bunch of utilities for poking around the PS2's kernel.
These are unused in the retail game, and wouldn't be "safe" to use on a retail console,
as later console revisions may have different memory layout of the BIOS. I suspect this
was used for the purposes of debugging and handling crashes.
They took over syscall 102 to access memory inside the kernel.

There's an error message:
"I CANNOT CONTINUE TO LOAD GOAL, BECAUSE THE KERNEL VERSION HAS CHANGED~%"
"~%Alternatively, try removing pskernel.gc and debug-handlers.gc from project.cl, do an (lg) and then (:r) again~%"

My theory is that debug-handlers.gc held crash handlers, and on load would install them using functions defined in pskernel.gc.
In the retail game, they removed debug-handlers, but not pskernel.

In the PC port, all of these functions are just stubs.
