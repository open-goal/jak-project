;; Each clock counts in 3 different ways:

;;     It counts elapsed time, in 1/300ths of a second.
;;     This counts in real-time, even if the game is lagging.
;;
;; 2). A "integral-frame-counter", which counts the number of vsyncs.
;;     This doens't count the number of frames the game actually manages to draw,
;;     just the number of vsyncs. It counts at different rates in NTSC/PAL.
;;     NOTE: changing clock-ratio will make this count faster/slower. This only counts real
;;           vsyncs if clock-ratio is 1.0.
;;
;; 3). The "time ratio", which adjusts based on the actual achieved framerate.
;;     Unlike the others, this isn't a incrementing counter, but instead ratios:
;;      time-adjust-ratio, frames-per-second, seconds-per-frame.
;;
;; For the most part, users should just adjust per-frame values by time-adjust-ratio, and this will
;; compensate for pal/ntsc, lag, and clock-ratio scaling.
;;
;; The clock won't tick if its process-mask is prevent-from-run in the kernel.
;; A clock can change the rate it runs at with clock-ratio.
;; Note: both integral-frame-counter and seconds-per-frame/frames-per-second are affected by
;; clock-ratio, which is somewhat weird.
