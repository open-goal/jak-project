;; Transformation. w components of vectors should be 1.0
;; This can represent any rotation, translation, and scaling.
;; Note that the scaling is applied before rotation (meaning it scales along the axes of the pre-transformed frame).

;; Like transform, but it's a basic.
;; note that the trsq child type overrides this rotation with a quaternion.
;; usage of the plain trs is very limited, at least in jak 1.
