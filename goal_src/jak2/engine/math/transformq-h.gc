;; a transform with:
;; - type information (child of basic)
;; - rotation stored as quaternion
;; - velocity information.
;; This is a very commonly used type to represent the position of an in-game object.
;; The "root" of a process-drawable (the parent "in-game object" type) is a trsqv.
;; Additionally, the collision system uses trsqv as the parent type for foreground
;; collision objects (collide-shape, collide-shape-moving)
;; As a result, this type has a lot of weird methods and extra stuff hidden in it.
