;; drawable-group is the base class for some drawable containers.
;; it is itself a drawable, though it typically doesn't have an ID.
;; it contains a dynamically sized array of drawables (in GOAL this means references to drawable objects).
;; these are typically used for higher level organization - iterating through many drawable-groups is not efficient due to
;; all the references.
;; note that in general you shouldn't assume that calling "draw" on a group will actually call "draw" on all the members -
;; different children classes may specialize these methods. (same goes for all the methods)

(deftype drawable-group (drawable)
  ((length  int16       :offset 6)
   (data    drawable 1  :offset-assert 32) ;; note that you get 1 drawable in the type, the rest run off the end.
