;; definition of type draw-node
(deftype draw-node (drawable)
  "Node in a bounding volume heirarchy. This is a base class, and there are no children.
The child is a pointer to the start of inline array of drawables (note: not a drawable-inline-array, literally a bunch of plain drawables)
The size of this array is child-count. The type is either more draw-nodes, or, some other drawable like tfragment, depending on the flags.
Different renderers have different restrictions on the tree structure, like max child count, or if all children have the same depth.
Generally, tfrag/collide use a very rigid equal depth, max 8 children rule, but with shrub, anything goes.
This is a very awkward data structure to traverse, but it is designed for fast view frustum culling.
Note that there can be multiple ways to reach drawables in here in some cases - for example you can follow
this tree, or check one of the depth arrays found in tfrag.
