;; definition of type drawable
(deftype drawable (basic)
  "Base class for `drawable` scene graph system.
This base class is really abused in many ways, and the meaning of the various methods differ depending
on the exact type. Not even the ID and bsphere here are always populated.
This is used for very high level organization of different rendering data types, and also very low-level
culling/rendering optimizations. It supports both array-of-references and inline-array containers with precise
control over memory layout for use with DMA."
