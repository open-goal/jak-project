Loop over effect

Loop over fragments 

First thing is the "row" data.
row.x/y is st-vif-add from the merc-ctrl-header.
TODO: what's zw??


Next is the unsigned-four.
This is unpacked with unpack8.
It always goes to 140 in the VU memory.
The source data is just the merc-fragment (I believe it includes merc-byte-header)

After is the lump-four. This has a STMOD enabled and is unpack8.
It goes after the unsigned-four (variable size) in VU memory.
The source data is after. Rounding in static data is ((u4c + 3) >> 2) << 4.

After is the Floating Point data. This is copied as unpack32.

_only_ on the first fragment of an effect, there's an upload to 132 of 8 qw:
the first 7 are lights.
the final is the first quadword of the merc-ctrl-header (xyz-scale, st-magic, st-out-a, st-out-b)

there are secrets hidden in the lights:
- light 0's w is some flag with ignore alpha in it.


Next is (optional) matrix uploads.
There is a loop of transfers. These are all size 7 qw.

Next is the MSCAL!
It has a different number of the first fragment of an effect.
This tells merc to load the light stuff.
